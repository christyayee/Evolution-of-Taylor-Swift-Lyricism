# Initial Project Proposal

### Introduction
Time in the limelight as long as that of Taylor Swift is rare in the volatile music industry. With a career spanning over 16 years and counting, 9 albums over 3 genres, and over 200 songs, whether you hate her or love her, it is no question that her discography is impressive. Often, music experts and her fans credit the reason for her continued relevance and success to her principal role and involvement in the songwriting and music production process of her albums. In particular, Taylor Swift has gained a reputation for her narrative songwriting style and detailed lyricism. As a result, since her debut, though she has matured from a wide-eyed teenage country singer to an international sensation, her growth is evident through her musical evolution, while remaining musically uniquely and authentically herself. With my research, I hope to investigate *“How has the lexicon and themes of Taylor Swift’s songwriting changed over time?”*  
 
### Motive 
With my data analysis, I hope to provide Taylor Swift newbies with a quick introduction to the topics and lyrical style covered throughout her discography, as well as potentially provide a pattern for dedicated Swifties to analyze and predict her next moves. Moreover, I’d be interested in determining the validity of criticism that she primarily writes breakup songs.  


### Data
For my research, I am using a dataset from Kaggle entitled “Taylor Swift Song Lyrics (All Albums)” which includes lyrics of every song from her debut album to her latest Red (Taylor’s Version). To clarify, the Deluxe version of albums are chosen instead of original album versions. Furthermore, if Taylor’s Version re-releases exist for an album, the Taylor’s Version is used. These decisions both maximize inclusion of her songs. However, the dataset only includes songs released within her albums, and therefore does not include songs she wrote for other artists or songs released along with films such as “Safe and Sound,” “I Don’t Want To Live Forever,” or “Only the Young” since they were released with Hunger Games, 50 Shades Darker, and Miss Americana respectively. Each row in the dataset details the corresponding album title, song title, track number, lyric, and line number of the lyric within its song.

### Analysis
With my analysis, I intend to determine themes present within each album in isolation and her discography overall by investigating the most frequently used words and phrases, along with a visualization to illustrate the words most associated with each. To better understand her change over time, I also plan on graphing the number of songs per album that incorporate her most popular words to investigate whether there is a thematic shift and when. I would also potentially perform a sentiment analysis to examine the highs and lows of her life growing up and through her journey of fame.   

Overall, through my research, my goal is to better understand Taylor Swift’s inspirations and life experiences that have shaped her and her music and have contributed to her lasting career. Ultimately, I hope to gain insight into her evolution as an artist and as a person.
