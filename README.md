# Evolution of Taylor Swift Lyricism

### Description
This repository contains the code for my analysis on the evolution of Taylor Swift's lyricism, as well as the datasets I used (obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thespacefreak/taylor-swift-song-lyrics-all-albums)) which includes lyrics of every song from her eponymous debut album to Fearless (Taylor’s Version).
Specically, my analysis sought to understand *"How has the lexicon of Taylor Swift’s songwriting changed over time?”* To do so, I investigasted word frequencies as well as sentiment analysis scores through all her albums over the course of her career thus far.
This project was completed as my final project for my class DH140 Coding for Humanities at UCLA.
